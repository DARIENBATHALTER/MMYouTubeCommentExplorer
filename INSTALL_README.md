## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Happens

macOS adds a "quarantine" attribute to downloaded apps for security. This is normal and affects all unsigned apps downloaded from the internet.

- All data processing happens locally on your computer

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No data leaves your computer** - everything runs locally

- **Open source** - you can inspect the code
